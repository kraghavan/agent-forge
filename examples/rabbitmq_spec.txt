# Example Specification: RabbitMQ Multi-Agent System

Agent one will create a docker container and inside it, this one will create a rabbitmq instance. It will create 1 exchange called books and 2 queues called fictional and non-fictional. Let the rabbitmq be available via its default port.

Agent 2 is a normal ubuntu 20 based docker image which runs a python script that publishes messages every so often. Expect this publisher to publish to fictional queue every 5 seconds and to non-fictional every 10 seconds.

Agent 3 is a normal ubuntu 20 based docker image which runs a python script that consumes messages every so often.

Here is the rabbitmq message payload sample you should follow:

{
  "header": {
    "message_id": "uuid-v4-string",
    "timestamp": "2026-01-28T15:51:00Z",
    "version": "1.0",
    "source": "content-engine-01"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "genre_type": "fictional", 
    "priority": "normal",
    "ttl_seconds": 30
  },
  "payload": {
    "entity_id": "book_98765",
    "action": "location_update",
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 49.262,
      "lng": -122.781
    },
    "context": "The protagonist is moving toward the enchanted forest."
  }
}
